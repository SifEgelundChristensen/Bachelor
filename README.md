# Bachelor
Code solving a constraint optimization model, created in bachelors project.

Bachelors project done in Integer programming in collaboration with DSB.
The scope of the project was optimizing DSB's cleaning schedule based on a big data set containing their train schedule (not available due to NDA).
3 models, in increasing complexity, was modeled and solved for minimizing price of cleaning and maximizing cleanliness of all trains.

This project and code was done in collaboration with fellow student Emma Victoria Lind.
